## Description
  🔍 This project is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, This project also includes unit tests for each part of the code and ensures that it passes all of them.

## User Story
      AS A manager
      I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
      SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

## Acceptance Criteria
      GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
      WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
      THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
      WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
      THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
      WHEN I click on the GitHub username
      THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
      WHEN I start the application
      THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
      WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
      THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
      WHEN I select the engineer option
      THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
      WHEN I select the intern option
      THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
